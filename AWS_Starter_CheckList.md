# Essential checklist when starting a new AWS account:

1. Delete default VPC, create a custom one
2. Set up budget alerts
3. Enable CloudTrail logs
4. Configure strong password policy
5. Enforce MFA for all users
6. Enable AWS Resource Explorer
7. Set up IAM roles and least privilege access
8. Enable AWS Security Hub for centralized security management
9. Implement tagging strategy for cost allocation
10. Enable AWS Organizations for multi-account strategy

# These steps establish a robust foundation for security, cost management, compliance, and scalability.

# Pro tip: Automate this process with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like AWS CloudFormation, AWS CDK or Terraform. It ensures consistency and saves time on future setups.
